## Delete without head pointer :
You are given a pointer/ reference to the node which is to be deleted from the linked list of N nodes. The task is to delete the node. Pointer/ reference to head node is not given. 
Note: No head reference is given to you. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the linked list.

**Example 1:**

Input: <br/>
N = 2 <br/>
value[] = {1,2} <br/>
node = 1 <br/>
Output: 2 <br/>
Explanation: After deleting 1 from the linked list, we have remaining nodes as 2.

**Example 2:**

Input:<br/>
N = 4<br/>
value[] = {10,20,4,30}<br/>
node = 20<br/>
Output: 10 4 30<br/>
Explanation: After deleting 20 from the linked list, we have remaining nodes as 10, 4 and 30.
